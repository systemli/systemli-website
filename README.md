# Source code for www.systemli.org
This static website is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
 and [octopress](https://github.com/octopress/).

Please improve by providing content, translations or code.

## Requirements
 * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Start development
 1. vagrant up
 2. Visit https://192.168.33.90

## Add new post
 * Write new post in `_posts/`.
 * Add translation also in `_posts/`.
 * `octopress id src/_posts/first_post src/_posts/second_post
 * restart jekyll

You can manually set the break point between teaser and full post with:
```
<!--more-->
```

## Add GPG key to WKS

If you have GnuPG >= 2.2.12

```
cd src/.well-known/
gpg --list-options show-only-fpr-mbox -k "admin@systemli.org" | /usr/lib/gnupg/gpg-wks-client -v --install
```

Don't include user keys. We can't disable listing since this is a git repo.

# deprecated
