Update 2019-06-06: Jabber account registration has been enabled again.

We had to temporarily turn off account registration on our [Jabber server](/en/service/xmpp.html),
because thousands of spam accounts got created by automated bots within the last days. For the
same reason, we unfortunately felt impelled to delete all accounts that got registered within
the last two weeks. If your account is amongh them, we hope that you understand and would like
to ask you for some patience. In case that you're in urgent need for a Jabber account, please
have a look at our [Friends and Fellows](/en/friends.html).

We're working on a solution to re-enable Jabber account registration (in a more secure way)
as soon as possible and will let you know by posting an update here.

In case of questions and/or problems, don't hesitate to [contact us](/en/kontakt.html).
