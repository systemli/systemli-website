<p>systemli.org has a public wiki with instructions and useful hints how to use our services (often including pictures). The wiki allows open registration, so that all users of our services can contribute to the instructions or write own manuals.</p>
<p>This is supposed to enable all users to share their knowledge with others and benefit from other's knowledge as well.</p>
<p>At the moment the large parts of our wiki are german only - sorry for that.</p>
