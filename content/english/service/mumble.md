Mumble is a free conference call software. With Mumble, you can call your friends.

The data traffic between client and server is fully encrypted and therefore  are also you calls.

By creating a channel, you can call different people at once. you can set a password for these channels, so only authorized people  can attend the conversation.

Official Mumble clients exist for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. For Android and iOS are a couple of alternative Clients (e.g. Plumble) available. [Download mumble client for your operating system.](https://www.mumble.info/downloads/mumble)
