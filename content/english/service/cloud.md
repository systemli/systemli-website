In the [systemli cloud](https://cloud.systemli.org/), you can organize your documents, notes and much more and work together on projects. We provide you with a privacy-friendly alternative to platforms like Dropbox, Google Docs or Trello.

The systemli cloud runs the open source software [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/).

For political groups and networks, the systemli cloud offers many functions to work collaboratively - from shared file storage over project organization and shared calendars to Collectives. In Collectives you can work together on texts and organize your shared knowledge.

Every systemli.org mail account has access to our cloud and with the same login credentials.

By using an app, you can have your data synchronized automatically to your computer or smartphone. You can find an overview of Nextcloud apps at the [Nextcloud website](https://nextcloud.com/install/).
