## Why using a ticker?

Big events like demonstrations and blockades need a higher organisational and technical effort. Fast communication is an important factor during actions to act coordinated.

Therefore, it is crucial to reach as many people as possible. It can also be useful to send news out quickly for a limited amount of people, for example during trial observations. It has been proven very useful over the last years to use the internet to make information available in real time. Ticker are practical for that. They give pooled and channeled information and offer horizontal decision-making.

With a ticker, you gain all the information at once, and it is not necessary to switch between different web sites, formats or portals. Additionally, ticker can be used with multiple device types like smartphones, WAP terminals or different browser types (Firefox, Chrome, Opera etc.). There are no additional costs for the end user other than the usual rate using data transfer via the internet.

## Our Offer

systemli wants to simplify the access to this communication tool. We already hosted and attended to a ticker system at different occasions (for example the 13th february in Dresden, trial observations in Vienna or for the 1st of May). The usage of the ticker during an action is in your hands. Through an easy usable, intuitive interface can you put new content online. Furthermore, you have the advantage of using Twitter and the ticker simultaneously. Therefore, a separate upload of content is unnecessary.
