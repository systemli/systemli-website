Since many years we offer an email service for friends and sympathisers. To register an email account, you need an invitation code. Every email account receives [three invitation codes](https://users.systemli.org) 7 days after registering. The codes can be passed on to friends and used for registering.

We have taken a conscious decision against an open registration system in order to prevent misuses of the service.

To protect your emails from being read by third parties, you should use GPG. The best solution is a combination of Thunderbird [(setup guide in the Wiki - german only)](https://wiki.systemli.org/howto/howto/thunderbird_systemli) and [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php).</p>

Additionally you can access your emails via browser with our [web client](https://mail.systemli.org/).
