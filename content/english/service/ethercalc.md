systemli.org calc allows to work on a spreadsheet collaboratively with multiple users. You can use it to edit a spreadsheet or a shift schedule/rota with your friends. It is apparent which person wrote which content. All common spreadsheet functions are integrated in the application.

## Features

* Collaboratively work on spreadsheets
* A lot of common spreadsheet functions (sum, average...)
* Import of spreadsheet documents

Obviously we ensure, that user entries cannot be intercepted. Therefore we consequently enforce encrypted connections to spreadsheets.

Spreadsheets which have not been edited for 30 days will be deleted automatically!
