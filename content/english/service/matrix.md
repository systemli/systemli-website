Matrix is a decentralized and end-to-end encrypted messaging service with good support for group chats. It is a free 
and open alternative to Signal and Slack. Unlike Signal, it is not tied to a phone number.

## Features

- End-to-end encryption for individual and group chats
- Phone number is not necessary
- Multi-Device-Support (Smartphone, Browser, Desktop)
- Networking with people and groups on [other Matrix servers](https://matrix.org/) (Federation)
- Only for systemli:
  - Messages are automatically deleted after 30 days
  - IP addresses are not stored

## Conditions

A Systemli email account is required for our server. As with e-mail, however, all other Matrix accounts can be 
contacted.

## Connection

```
Homeserver: matrix.systemli.org
```

## Usage

To connect to Matrix, instead of [our web client](https://element.systemli.org), you can also install
[an app](https://element.io/get-started) can be installed. A good documentation of the client
[offered by the TU Dresden](https://doc.matrix.tu-dresden.de/en/).
