teaser: Create (encrypted) meeting schedules or other online surveys
---

<p>Croodle is an open-source-programm (<a href="https://github.com/jelhan/croodle">sourcecode on github</a>) to create meeting schedules or other online surveys.</p>
<p>Contrary to Doodle, Croodle focuses on data security. The survey data is stored encrypted on the server.</p>
<p>Not even the server operator knows the content of the survey. Only the people receiving the survey link can see the survey and/or use it.</p>

<h3>Further features of Croodle:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You can offer as many <b>answering possibilities</b> as you want. You can choose your favourite date in the <b>calendar</b> or <b>create multiple questions</b>.</li>
    <li>You can use <b>pre-defined answering possibilities</b> like yes, no, maybe  or allow <b>self-generated answers</b>.</li>
    <li>You keep your view free through an automatically updated <b>summary of the favored answers</b>.</li>
    <li>Your data stays private: It will already be <b>encrypted</b> in your browser. Only the people you sent the survey link to know, what the survey is about.</li>
</ul>
