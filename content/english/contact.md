### FAQ

If you encounter any problems, take a look into our [Frequently asked questions](https://wiki.systemli.org/faq) (german only), before contacting us. There, we collect answers to common questions.

### Mail

If you have requests, questions, suggestions or critique, write to [support@systemli.org](mailto:support@systemli.org).

We will answer to your request quicker if you encrypt your E-Mails via GPG. You can get our public key [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/776E7B48BDE8E769CBBCD29210D46141EC77D27B) or from a public key-server with the command:

`gpg --recv-keys 776E7B48BDE8E769CBBCD29210D46141EC77D27B`

Please attach your public GPG key to the email request to make things easier for us.

The clearer you describe your request, the faster we can find a solution. Please describe in detail which login details you are using. But **never** send us any passwords.

For example, if you cannot log into a service, the following information is helpful for us:

* service address
* user name
* service settings, e.g. connection settings from your e-mail

Often it is also useful to know which programs or operating system you are using. If your program shows any error messages, please send these as text or screenshot.
