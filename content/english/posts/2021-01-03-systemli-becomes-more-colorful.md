For a while now, we're giving our services piece by piece their own design, or at least customize them so that they are 
easier to recognize as a systemli.org service. We started with [Jitsi Meet]({{< ref "meet" >}}) and 
[Nextcloud]({{< ref "cloud" >}}). Now our website follows with a brand new design.<!--more-->

[In just under eight years]({{< ref "2013-09-14-Fresh-colours-on-systemli.org.md" >}}), very little had happened to the 
design of our website. However, a few things have changedi contentwise: We offer many more 
[services]({{< ref "service" >}}), use the [ticker]({{< ref "ticker" >}}) to 
[inform about maintenance work](https://updates.systemli.org/) and 
[certificates no longer have to be checked manually]({{< ref "2017-10-18-Lets-Encrypt.md" >}}).

With the new design, we especially want to put our services and status updates in the spotlight. We would like to thank 
[gegenfeuer](https://www.gegenfeuer.net/) and batabana for creating the design and implementing it according to our 
many big and small wishes.

With the new website, we also changed the underlying tooling. We no longer use Jekyll to generate the website, but 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and instead of Bootstrap, we use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as CSS framework.
