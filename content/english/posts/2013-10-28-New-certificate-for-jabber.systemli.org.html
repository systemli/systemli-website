<p>From tomorrow on (29.10.2013) the Jabber server has a new SSL certificate. This will be valid for two years.<br>
The new fingerprint is: <code>01:99:A9:C1:4A:A3:23:B3:0C:C1:F4:F7:2E:21:B0:2A:94:64:E1:35</code></p>
<p>You can read in our <a href="<https://wiki.systemli.org/howto/jabber_eng#b_test_ssl_certificate">Wiki</a> how to check and compare the fingerprint. This is important so you can be sure your encryption with us works correctly.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or notice any irregularities, <a href=/en/kontakt.html>please contact us.</a></p>
