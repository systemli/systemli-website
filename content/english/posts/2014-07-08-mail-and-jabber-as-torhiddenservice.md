title:  "Feature: Mail and Jabber as Tor Hiddenservice"

From now on we offer **mail.systemli.org** and **jabber.systemli.org** as [Tor Hidden Service](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en).

This enables our users to set up a hidden connection to our services that is channeled through the Tor network.

We run these installations as a test first and would be happy to get some <a href="mailto:support@systemli.org">feedback</a> about it from you.<br><br>
