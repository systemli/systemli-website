Systemli is a [left-wing network and technics-collective](/en/about-us.html).
We support emancipatory groups and individuals with technical infrastructure and know-how, in our spare time.
This explicitly doesn't include free speech apologists or crypto market liberals.
Therefore, we published our [terms of services](/en/tos.html) a while ago.
Thereby, we aim to demonstrate for which projects we engage and in what scope.

> We have an understanding of ourselves working as a political collective.
> The usage of our services depends on the compatibility with our self-conception.
> We will prevent usage that contradicts our understanding.
> We reserve the right to delete the relevant accounts and related content in such cases.

Happily, we support political campaigns like [#unteilbar](https://www.unteilbar.org/aktionen/unteilbar-sachsen/) (German: indivisible).
On the coming weekend, thousands of people will rally in Dresden, Germany under this banner against the political lurch to the right and for a solidary and diverse society.
