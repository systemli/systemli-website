We've been busy with our [user portal](https://users.systemli.org/). Recently, we've added a new feature for you: You 
can now manage your own _alias addresses_. Those are e-mail addresses, which act as a pseudonym for your own e-mail 
addresses. You can have three chosen and up to 100 random _alias addresses_. The latter, are supposed to be used in web 
shops or alike.

Random _alias addresses_ have 24 random characters before the @. They're supposed to be used with web services or 
alike. You can delete them at any time, so that you won't receive spam.

Furthermore, our user portal is now finally free software [on Github](https://github.com/systemli/user-management/).

One more small change: The invite codes you've already used, are not visible anymore.

As always, please [contact us]({{< ref "contact" >}}), if you have any question or suggestion.
