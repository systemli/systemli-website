On the 28.02.2022 our Ethercalc service - calc.systemli.org will be terminated.
Please export or transfer your data to another calc-software provider until this date!

The service does not meet our security standards anymore, because the used software
wasn't updated for a longer period of time.

A possible better alternative is cryptpad with client side encryption:

* [cryptpad.ffmuc.net](https://cryptpad.ffmuc.net/)
* [cryptpad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr/)
