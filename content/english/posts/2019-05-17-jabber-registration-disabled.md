We had to temporarily turn off account registration on our Jabber-Server, because thousands of
spam accounts got created by automated bots within the last days. For the same reason, we unfortunately felt impelled
to delete all accounts that got registered within the last two weeks. If your account is amongh them, we hope that you
understand and would like to ask you for some patience. In case that you're in urgent need for a Jabber account, please
have a look at our [Friends]({{< ref "friends" >}}).

We're working on a solution to re-enable Jabber account registration (in a more secure way) as soon as possible and
will let you know by posting an update here.

In case of questions and/or problems, don't hesitate to [contact us]({{< ref "contact" >}}).

Update 2019-06-06: Jabber account registration has been enabled again.
