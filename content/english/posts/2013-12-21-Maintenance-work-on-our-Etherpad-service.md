On **27.12.2013 18:00** we will do maintenance work on our Etherpad service. The system will therefore not be available 
for several hours.

The maintenance work is necessary because of a lot up updates of the software and changes in the internal structure. 
In future it will be more simple for us to delete Pads on your request and to get rid of old Pads in order to prevent 
data accumulation. We will take this measure separately though and communicate it transparently.
