All Systemli accounts now have more storage space available in the [cloud]({{<ref "cloud">}}). We have increased the limit from 250 MB to 1 GB. This limit has not been increased for many years, although usage and demand have grown steadily.

We still offer groups and structures the option of obtaining additional storage space. You can simply [contact us]({{<ref "contact">}}) and describe your needs.

We would still like to encourage you to regularly clean up the data in the cloud and delete files that are no longer needed. This saves capacity on our side and you don't accumulate so much data on our servers.
