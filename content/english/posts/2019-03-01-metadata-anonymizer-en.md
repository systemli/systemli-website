Starting today, we have a new service: <a target="_blank" href="https://metadata.systemli.org/">metadata.systemli.org</a>, a metadata cleaner.

At <a target="_blank" href="https://metadata.systemli.org/">metadata.systemli.org</a> you can upload files and let them be cleaned of metadata. That's particularly useful to obfuscate autors and editors of the files. To remove metadata, the program <a href target="_blank" href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">mat2</a> is used.

<strong>Important:</strong> It's much better and more secure to install and run <a href target="_blank" href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">mat2</a> on your own computer. When using this webservice, you have to trust us. That's not necessary when running the program on your own computer.

Since running mat2 locally is not an option for everybody (e.g. for people who run Windows), we decided to host the service despite the valid security concerns.
