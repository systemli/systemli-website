We have increased the password security in the most recent version of our [user portals](https://users.systemli.org).
If you set a new password, it is automatically tested against the [password database of "Have I been pwned"](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
First, your password "test" is transformed with SHA-1 hash function to `a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3`.

Then, the first five characters `a94a8` of this hash are sent to "Have I been pwned".
This service replies with a list of possible matches from databases that are used by password crackers.
Lastly, our user portal checks if there is an actual match and shows you a warning if necessary.
"Have I been pwned" never sees your actual password, parts of it or your IP address.
[Other software](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Consumers) also offers this functionality.
The integration with a password manager like [KeePass](https://github.com/andrew-schofield/keepass2-haveibeenpwned) or
[Pass](https://gitlab.com/darnir/pass-audit) is especially useful.

Bokm√•l.
You should be automatically redirected to the applicable language or you can choose it in the upper right.
