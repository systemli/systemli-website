<p>We now offer a <a href="https://users.systemli.org" target="_blank"> tool for registering and administrating your email-account</a>. The registration works with invitation-codes and every existing account receives three invitation-codes 7 day after registering. </p>

<p>You can invite your friends to create a data-protecting email-account with systemli.org by passing on one of your codes.
Furthermore, you can change the password of your email-account with this tool. We have introduced a password-policy to ensure that no-one chooses a password that is easy to guess.</p>

<p>Adding to the launch of the invitation-system, we did some improvements in our email-service. You can now also access your emails of a different provider. For example: You don't want to use your Googlemail-account anymore? No problem, <a href="https://mail.systemli.org/?_task=settings&_action=plugin.getmail" target="_blank"> just get the mails via your systemli.org-account</a>. If you work from different computers and want to sort and filter the emails, <a href="https://mail.systemli.org/?_task=settings&_action=plugin.managesieve" target="_blank">we would recommend the server filtering and sorting of emails directly on our server</a>. Especially when using this in <a href="https://www.systemli.org/en/2014/06/29/monitor-your-user-data.html" target="_blank">combination with aliases </a> there are simple solutions to managing a large amount of emails.</p>

<p>In the future we would like to develop the administration tool further. This includes the possibility to restore a forgotten password, to contact us and much more.</p>
