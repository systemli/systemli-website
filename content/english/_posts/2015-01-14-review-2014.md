[![shirts]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/shirts_small.jpg)]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/shirts.jpg)
The last year is over and since our last update some time went by, too.
Therefore, since time we start with the most important things. We want to say ‚thank you’ to all the people who have helped this year to make systemli.org possible and keep it running.
 
- Thanks to all the amazing Organizers and Helpers for the solidarity party  we had 5th of September. Your are awesome! The party was fantastic.
- Thanks to the  [CCC](http://ccc.de/)  and all the other donors. Your money helped us a lot.
- Thanks to  [M/Monit](http://mmonit.com/),  which provided us with their software for a reasonable price to make our service even more resilient.
- Thanks to all the members of our collective. Every contribution to the project, no matter what kind, is extremely precious. 

### Shirts
We printed shirts!

If you want to order a shirt, please transfer 13,50€  (shipping to Germany only) to
[our bank account or post box](/en/support-us.html) and send us a mail with your favorite colour, size and your address.
Please make sure that we can attribute mail and transfer.

Following sizes are available:
 - unisize, blue: <del>S</del>, <del>M</del>, <del>L</del>, XL

 - tapered, black: XS, S, M, L

If you already transfer a donation regularly, please send us an e-mail and we will give you a shirt as a 'thank you'. Otherwise, to buy a shirt is a good way to show your support.

### Services
We offer two new service:
 - talk.systemli.org - a room-based audiochat based on [Mumble](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page)
 - [www.systemli.org/poll](https://www.systemli.org/poll) - an encrypted Doodle alternative based on [croodle](https://github.com/jelhan/croodle)
    
Please try them out and give us feedback. We can only improve services if we know what you don´t like.

### Also
- We gave two German interviews to the radio, which you can listen to [here](http://www.freie-radios.net/65896)  and [here](/assets/audio/systemli_beitrag_gesamt.mp3)
- Due to the [security lack Poodle] (https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-290A), we disabled SSLv3 in all our services and no one complained.
- The introduction of our [mail-service](/en/service/mail.html)  was well accepted. If you want to invite further friends, please log in at [https://users.systemli.org](https://users.systemli.org) and send them an invitation-code.

### Future
We are looking for people which enjoy the involvement with technology. We are especially looking for:

 - PHP- developers

     With us you can learn how to deal with Symfony 2 and practice with useful application. Come on, that´s cooler than doing the programming on you own.

 - people who are good at writing

     A key interest of systemli.org is not only to make technology safer, but also accessible. If you only see #?!_§+# while reading our website, you could be the right person to improve our style and writing.
    
For a 2015 in solidarity  
your systemli.org collective
