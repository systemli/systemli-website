We wish to express our support for [the statement riseup.net published yesterday](https://help.riseup.net/en/about-us/press/security-not-a-crime).

> On Tuesday December 16th, a large police operation took place in the Spanish State. Fourteen houses and social centers were raided in Barcelona, Sabadell, Manresa, and Madrid. Books, leaflets, computers were seized and eleven people were arrested and sent to the Audiencia Nacional, a special court handling issues of "national interest", in Madrid. They are accused of incorporation, promotion, management, and membership of a terrorist organisation. However, lawyers for the defence denounce a lack of transparency, saying that their clients have had to make statements without knowing what they are accused of. "`[They]` speak of terrorism without specifying concrete criminal acts, or concrete individualized facts attributed to each of them" `[2]`. When challenged on this, Judge Bermúdez responded: "I am not investigating specific acts, I am investigating the organization, and the threat they might pose in the future" `[1]`; making this yet another case of apparently preventative arrests.
> 
> Four of the detainees have been released, but seven have been jailed pending trial. The reasons given by the judge for their continued detention include the posession of certain books, "the production of publications and forms of communication”, and the fact that the defendants "used emails with extreme security measures, such as the RISE UP server" `[2]`.
> 
> We reject this Kafka-esque criminalization of social movements, and the ludicrous and extremely alarming implication that protecting one's internet privacy is tantamount to terrorism.
> 
> Riseup, like any other email provider, has an obligation to protect the privacy of its users. Many of the "extreme security measures" used by Riseup are common best practices for online security and are also used by providers such as hotmail, GMail or Facebook. However, unlike these providers, Riseup is not willing to allow illegal backdoors or sell our users' data to third parties.
> 
> The European Parliament's report on the US NSA surveillance program states that "privacy is not a luxury right, but the foundation stone of a free and democratic society" `[3]`. Recent revelations about the extent to which States violate everyone's right to privacy show that everything that can be spied upon will be spied upon `[4]`. Furthermore, we know that criminalizing people for using privacy tools also has a chilling effect on everybody, and human-rights defenders, journalists, and activists, in particular. Giving up your basic right to privacy for fear of being flagged as a terrorist is unacceptable.
