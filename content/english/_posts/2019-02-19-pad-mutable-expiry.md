We copied a bit from our friends at <a href="https://riseup.net/">Riseup</a> and improved
our <a href="https://pad.systemli.org">pad service</a>.

When creating new pads, there's now three options for the expiry time that you can choose
from. For ephemeral pads you choose "1 Tag" (1 day), the default stays "30 Tage" (30 days)
and for long-lasting projects, there's "1 Jahr" (1 year).
