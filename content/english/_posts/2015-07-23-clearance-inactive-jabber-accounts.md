On August 1st we will delete all the jabber accounts, which have not been active for more than a year.

A year ago we changed our Jabber-Server to [Prosody](https://prosody.im/).
Prosody allows us to store user passwords encrypted. The encryption is activated when a user first logs in.

Whoever has  logged into jabber during the last year does not have to do anything.
Everyone else should log in until August 1st, otherwise their accounts will be cleared.
