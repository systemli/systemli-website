<p>The last couple of years users expressed the wish for a software, where multiple users could work on a spreadsheet together.
    After a long search and the attempt to teach our pad software to create charts, we found a suitable software:  <a href="https://ethercalc.net/">Ethercalc</a> </p>

<p>We´ve had positive experience using <a href="https://pad.systemli.org">Pad-Service</a> and we´d like to follow up on that with <a href="https://calc.systemli.org">Calc-Service</a>


<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> work on a spreadsheet together </li>
    <li> a lot of common spreadsheet functions (sum, average...)</li>
    <li>Import of spreadsheet documents</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Please be aware that all spreadsheet documents will be deleted 30 days after last processing it!</strong></p>

<p>Out thanks goes out to the developers at <a href="https://ethercalc.net/">Ethercalc</a>, ypu can find their software in their <a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc">Github Repository</a></p>

<p>We published a <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/role/6657">Ansible-Rolle</a>, with which it should be possible for you to create an Ethercalc-Instance. You can find it at the associated <a href="https://github.com/systemli/ansible-ethercalc">Github-Repository</a></p>
