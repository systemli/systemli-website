End of last year it became known that there had been a successful attack against the hard drive-encryption of many Linux systems. The widely used Linux-distribution Ubuntu was affected as well. A few days ago Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has been released which is immune against these attacks and will be maintained for 5 years. 

A simple upgrade of the distribution is not able to close the attack vector. Therefore we encourage you to treat your computer to a completely new installation. Encrypting the hard drive with Ubuntu completely needs only one click and immensely improves your security against physical attacks.
