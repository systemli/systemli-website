Recently, our users have received an increased amount of questions for invite codes from unknown people.
The senders even promised money and access to software exploits in exchange for invite codes and explain in detail how to find them.
This is an attack by spammers who want to abuse our non-commercial mail service for their business.
These action transgress our [terms of services]({{ site.url }}/en/tos.html) and we won't tolerate them.

Let us therefore clarify once again:
We are a non-commercial provider, primarily aimed at politically active persons and organizations.
We sacrifice our leisure time to support emancipatory causes with digital infrastructure.
For this very reason, our registration is limited and we only allocate an account without an invite code in individual justified cases.
We do not award mail accounts or invite codes for money and do not accept this behavior from our users.
