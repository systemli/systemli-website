Our [Etherpad-service](https://pad.systemli.org) has a new look. This is supposed to encourage you to avoid names that are easy to guess for confidential Pads. 

The content of Pads is only secret as long as no-one else knows its URL. Because the Pads can always be found under **https://pad.systemli.org/p/Name**, everyone who can guess its name can also access the content.

To avoid choosing a too simple name, the Pad-names will from now on be automatically generated as a first step (to the NoScript-User â€“ please allow  [pad.systemli.org](https://pad.systemli.org). This should make it difficult to guess the names of the Pads.

If you would really like to use a name thats easy to guess, you can still do that. Instead of the automatically generated digits and numbers, just insert your chosen name into the same field.
