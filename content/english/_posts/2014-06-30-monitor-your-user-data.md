With an email-account at systemli.org you have the possibility to monitor if anyone is passing on your user data to third parties.

When ordering something at an online shop you are requested to provide user data, e.g. name, date of birth and email-address. If your account is for example in the name of **anna@systemli.org**, you can give the email-address **anna+onlineshop@systemli.org** to the online shop. An email coming from the shop is sent to **anna@systemli.org** as usual â€“ but in your in-box the recipient-field now reads **anna+onlineshop@systemli.org**.

If you receive other emails from other senders to the recipient  **anna+onlineshop@systemli.org**, you can be certain that the online shop has passed on your data.

To be able to monitor in detail who passes on your data, you have to use a different pseudonym for every online shop/ website ( **anna+ebay@systemli.org** , **anna+lidl@systemli.org**, **anna+zalando@systemli.org** ... ).
