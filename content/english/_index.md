## Improved ticker software

Our ticker helps you with live coverage of demonstrations and other events. This way, we want to increase the visibility 
of social movements. Last year we completely rewrote the software. It now offers the possibility to attach pictures and 
maps to messages. Furthermore it can now be run under your own domain (e.g. ticker.your-action.org). Check out more 
details [on our services page](/en/service/ticker)!
