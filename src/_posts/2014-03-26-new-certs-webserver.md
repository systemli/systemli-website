excerpt: In the last days we provided new certificates for [www.systemli.org](https://systemli.org/en/index.html) , [pad.systemli.org](https://pad.systemli.org) and all sub-domains of [tem.li](https://tem.li). These were signed by the Gandi certification body. This certification body is integrated in all common browsers and only gives warning in the case of SSL errors.
