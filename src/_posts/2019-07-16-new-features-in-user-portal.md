We have increased the password security in the most recent version of our [user portals](https://users.systemli.org).
If you set a new password, it is automatically tested against the [password database of "Have I been pwned"](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
In this process, only a part of your password hash is sent to the service.
"Have I been pwned" replies with a list of possible matches from databases that are used by password crackers.
Lastly, our user portal checks if there is an actual match and shows you a warning if necessary.

[Other software](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Consumers) also offers this functionality.
The integration with a password manager like [KeePass](https://github.com/andrew-schofield/keepass2-haveibeenpwned) or [Pass](https://gitlab.com/darnir/pass-audit) is especially useful.

![language_switcher](/assets/img/language_switcher.png)
Our [user portal](https://users.systemli.org) now supports the languages English, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Bokm√•l.
You should be automatically redirected to the applicable language or you can choose it in the upper right.
Please help us to improve these translations or add new ones at [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/userli/)!
