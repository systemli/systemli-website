We will shut down our old owncloud instance **cloud.tem.li** with immediate effect.

If you haven't made your data migration yet, you have to contact us.

Then you will get an email voucher to register an email account, which you will need to login into our new cloud.

You can also get your old quota size back :) 

The **new Cloud** with new [features](https://www.systemli.org/en/2016/03/26/owncloud-en.html) is available via [cloud.systemli.org](https://cloud.systemli.org)
