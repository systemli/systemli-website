systemli.org mail users now can [upload their public OpenPGP key to our
Web Key Directory](https://users.systemli.org/en/openpgp) to make their
keys discoverable by mail clients.

Finding OpenPGP keys of your communication partners is still difficult in 2020.
One approach to make it easier is called [OpenPGP Web Key Directory
(WKD)](https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD).

Your mail client will look for the key under a specific URI via HTTPS,
leveraging it's security and authenticity.

To make it easier for your friends to find your public key, you can now upload
it at [users.systemli.org](https://users.systemli.org/en/openpgp) and their
clients will fetch it automatically.

Please beware that you have to take care yourself of updating your key in the
Web Key Directory. Also, all mail addresses except the one belonging to your
account will be stripped from the key at upload.

A small catch: Right now, our solution doesn't support OpenPGP keys for your
alias addresses. We hope to resolve this shortcoming this soon.
