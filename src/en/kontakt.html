<p>We will answer to your request quicker if you encrypt your E-Mails via GPG. You can get our public key <a href="/assets/0xF76A41F3928909A9740E780D5BBCA3A6D97806C1.asc">here</a> or from a public key-server with the command: </p><p><code>gpg --recv-keys 0xF76A41F3928909A9740E780D5BBCA3A6D97806C1</code></p>

<p>The clearer you describe your request, the faster we can find a solution. Please  describe in detail which login details you are using. But <strong>never</strong> send us any passwords.</p>

  <li>user name</li>
  <li>service settings, e.g. connection settings from your e-mail oder jabber server</li>
