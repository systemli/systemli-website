<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>If you encounter any problems, take a look into our <a href="https://wiki.systemli.org/faq">Frequently asked questions</a> (german only), before contacting us. There, we collect answers to common questions.</p>

<h3>Mail</h3>
<p>If you have requests, questions, suggestions or critique, write to <a href="mailto:support@systemli.org">support@systemli.org</a>.</p>
<p>We will answer to your request quicker if you encrypt your E-Mails via GPG. You can get our public key <a href="/assets/0x776E7B48BDE8E769CBBCD29210D46141EC77D27B.asc">here</a> or from a public key-server with the command: </p><p><code>gpg --recv-keys 0x776E7B48BDE8E769CBBCD29210D46141EC77D27B</code></p>

<p>The clearer you describe your request, the faster we can find a solution. Please  describe in detail which login details you are using. But <strong>never</strong> send us any passwords.</p>

<p>For example, if you cannot log into a service, the following information is helpful for us:
<ul>
  <li>service address</li>
  <li>user name</li>
  <li>service settings, e.g. connection settings from your e-mail oder jabber server</li>
</ul>
Often it is also useful to know which programs or operating system you are using. If your program shows any error messages, please send these as text or screenshot.</p>
