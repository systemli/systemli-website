<p>Everyone who works for systemli.org does that as an unpaid volunteer. Besides time, providing our services and infrastructure continuously costs a lot of money.
The news about PRISM, Tempora and the new spying initiative of the BND (German intelligence service) show how important an independent infrastructure based on solidarity is.</p>
<p>There are several possibilities to support us:</p>

<h3>Enhance our wiki</h3>
<p>We provide several how-tos and handy tips in our <a href="https://wiki.systemli.org">wiki</a>. From time to time those pages need translations or the content needs an upgrade. If there is something missing, you should <a href="https://wiki.systemli.org/start?do=register">create an account</a> and add it.</p>

<h3>Questions, criticism, enhancements</h3>
<p>To provide a better service, we need your feedback. Is something not working as supposed? Is something missing? In such cases, we encourage you to write us an <a href="mailto:support@systemli.org">e-mail!</a></p>

<h3>Improving our software projects and webpage</h3>
<p>Some of our Ansible roles and other software projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/systemli/">our Github page</a>. We're always happy about patches and improvements.
Moreover, we want to raise your attentention for the <a href="https://github.com/systemli/systemli-website">source code of our website</a>. Here you can add new content or translate our website into other languages. We would be pleased, if we could reach more people with more understandable content.
</p>

<h3>Shirts and merchandise</h3>
<p>You can get our shirts and merchandise (stickers, bookmarks, postcards) in the web shop of <a href="https://black-mosquito.org/en/catalogsearch/result/?q=systemli">Black Mosquito</a>.</p>

<h3>Donations</h3>
<p>To be able to provide this infrastructure in the future, we are dependent on your donations. We would be very happy if every user could donate a little money to us or even arrange a standing order. Every donation helps.</p>
<p>We would love for every project that uses our services to donate 100 Euros annually. But this is no criteria for exclusion. For projects without money we will find other solutions.</p>
<p>For individuals who use our services it would be appropriate to donate <strong>1 Euro per account per month</strong>. Who can donate even more money is very welcome to do so â€“ this will enable people with low income to use our services for free.</p>
