It took nearly 10 years, but we have finally done it. We have fundamentally revised our website. Besides contact options and the fingerprints of our SSL-certificates you can now also find an overview of our services. On the respective pages there is a description of the services and how to use them.

With this new homepage we also want to engage in a different way of communicating with you. In future we would like to act more transparent and keep you updated about the processes and evolution of systemli.org. Latest news (server problems etc.) will as always be published on our [Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/systemli).
