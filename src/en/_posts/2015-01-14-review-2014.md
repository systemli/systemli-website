### Future
We are looking for peopel which enjoy the involvement with technics. We are especially looking for:

 - PHP- developers

     With us you can learn how to deal with Sympfony 2 and practice with useful application. Come on, that´s cooler than doing the programming on you own.

 - people who are good at writing

     A key intererest of systemli.org is not only to make technic safer, but also accessible. If you only see #?!_§+# while reading our website, you could be the right person to improve our style and writing.
    
For a 2015 in solidarity  
your systemli.org collective
