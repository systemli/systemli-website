<p>systemli.org calc allows to work on a spreadsheet collaboratively with multiple users. You can use it to edit a spreadsheet or a shift schedule/rota with your friends. It is apparent which person wrote which content. All common spreadsheet functions are integrated in the application.

<p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Collaboratively work on spreadsheets</li>
    <li>A lot of common spreadsheet functions (sum, average...)</li>
    <li>Import of spreadsheet documents</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Obviously we ensure, that user entries cannot be intercepted. Therefore we consequently enforce encrypted connections to spreadsheets.</p>
<p><strong>Spreadsheets which have not been edited for 30 days will be deleted automatically!</strong></p>
