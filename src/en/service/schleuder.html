<p>We provide encrypted Schleuder mailing lists for political groups and organizations. The body of mails to/from Schleuder lists is OpenPGP encrypted and that way protected from snoopy eyes. For that reason, Schleuder lists are most useful for internal communication.</p>

<p>Schleuder mailing lists are slightly more complex than normal mailing lists to use and maintain. In return they protect your communication from snoopy eyes on it's way through the internet. All subscribers should know how to use OpenPGP encryption for mails.</p>

<p>Please note that Schleuder lists are <i>not</i> end-to-end encrypted. Mails to schleuder lists are encrypted while being delivered to the Schleuder server, will be decrypted there and are sent again encrypted to all subscribers of the list immediately. Naturally we don't look into the mails, but please keep in mind that you still have to trust us as your Schleuder server admins.</p>
