We host your web sites. We offer tools for knowledge management and hosting of wordpress blogs. Regarding that, we have some general information you should note.

### Conditions

Our hosting offer targets primarily groups and organisations. To be hosted by us, you should meet the following criteria:

  * your website does not contain self-written code
  * your website indicates a contact information.
  
We expect you to keep the software of your website updated and check them regularly. If you don´t, we reserve the right to deactivate your website without consultation.
  
Furthermore, we check if your website content is getting updated. In case this has not been happening for two years, we see the website as outdated. Outdated websites can - if you wish - be archived and therefore preserved. We might contact your regarding the options. If we cannot reach you, we reserve the right to disable and delete your website.

  * We encourage you to publish your content under a free license (e.g. [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) or [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)) to allow re-use.
  * We don't want services with us that collect personal data of users. This includes e.g. Google Analytics and external content delivery networks (CDN).
  * We encourage you to make your websites barrier-free accessible.
  * We delete websites that haven't been configured 90 days after provisioning.

For public websites like blogs and news portals, it can be useful to know how often content is being read. Most websites use Google Analytics for that.
