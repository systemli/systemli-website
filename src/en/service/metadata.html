<p>At <a target="_blank" href="https://metadata.systemli.org/">metadata.systemli.org</a> you can upload files and let them be cleaned of metadata. That's particularly useful to obfuscate autors and editors of the files. To remove metadata, the program <a href target="_blank" href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">mat2</a> is used.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> It's much better and more secure to install and run <a href target="_blank" href="https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2">mat2</a> on your own computer. When using this webservice, you have to trust us. That's not necessary when running the program on your own computer.</p>

<p>We configured the service as secure as possible:
<ul>
    <li>The service is accessible via transport encryption only</li>
    <li>Uploaded files will be stored in an encrypted container. The encryption key is randomly generated and we don't know it</li>
    <li>Uploaded files will be deleted automatically when they're downloaded</li>
    <li>Files older than five minutes will be deleted immediately</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The maximum allowed size of uploaded files is 16MB.</p>
