<p>For all users with a systemli.org mail address, we offer an own <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> service. Nextcloud is a free alternative to Dropbox.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://cloud.systemli.org">https://cloud.systemli.org</a>, you can file data and folders and use them on different devices. </p>

<p>It's also available as Tor Hidden Service via <a href="http://3leihwb7bynsbiey.onion">http://3leihwb7bynsbiey.onion</a> (only via TorBrowser).</p>

<p>With the provision of an own Nextcloud instance, we want to offer you the usage of a cloud with all its advantages without losing your privacy.</p>

<p>To <b>log in</b>, just <b>use your mail username</b> and <b>password</b> you are using to check your mails.</p>

<p>Another (and more convenient) way is using a client, which you can install on your computer or mobile phone. You can find all Nextcloud clients at the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients">official website</a>. If you can't find a client for your system, you can also use the <a href="https://owncloud.org/install/#install-clients">ownCloud clients</a>.</p>
